        <h2>Elo Rating</h2>
        <p>For those looking to improve their chess game, there is a wealth of resources available. One of the most important metrics in chess is the Elo rating system, which rates a player's skill level based on their performance in games against other rated players. When a player plays a game against another rated player, the outcome of the game is used to adjust their ratings. If the higher-rated player wins, their rating will stay the same or increase slightly, and the lower-rated player's rating will decrease. If the lower-rated player wins, their rating will increase significantly, and the higher-rated player's rating will decrease. The highest recorded Elo rating was achieved by Norwegian grandmaster Magnus Carlsen, who reached a rating of 2882 in 2014.</p>
        
        <h2>Streamers</h2>
        <p>There are many well-known chess influencers such as Gotham Chess, the Botez sisters, Eric Rosen, Hikaru Nakamura, and Agadmator, who offer tutorials and gameplay analysis to help players improve their skills as well as books like "My System" by Aron Nimzowitsch and "How to Reassess Your Chess" by Jeremy Silman, which have helped many players elevate their game. Even the best player in the world, Magnus Carlesen, ocassionally streams on twitch!</p>
        
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>It is of the utmost importance that you analyze your games after playing them. The ability to have a computer look at your game and calculate what you did wrong, what you did right, and relay all of that information right back to you is priceless when it comes to improving your game. Studying what the computer thinks of your playstyle, and adjusting when you see that you've messed up leads to learning patterns in the game of chess. Once you learn some of these patterns you will be able to play a lot more accurately and quickly.</p>
