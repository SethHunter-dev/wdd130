        [Chess is a game of skill, strategy, and mental agility. It's no wonder why it has been enjoyed for centuries, with its origins dating back to the Gupta Empire in India around the 6th century. I am sure you have seen a chessboard before, but here is how you can start playing right now (ranks are horizontal rows and files are vertical columns of squares on the chessboard).
        To start the game, each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The pieces are set up on the board in a specific way, with the pawns in front and the major pieces behind them.
        On each turn, a player may move one of their pieces according to its movement rules. The king can move one square in any direction, while the queen (worth 9 points) can move any number of squares in a straight line along a rank, file, or diagonal. The rooks (5 points) move any number of squares along a rank or file, the knights (3 points) move in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that, and the bishops (3 points) move any number of squares diagonally. The pawns (1 point) are the weakest pieces and can only move forward one square at a time, except for their first move when they can move two squares forward. Pawns capture diagonally and can promote to any piece if they reach the other side of the board. The point system does not actually give the player any points. It is simply a measurement of how powerful a piece is. If a player moves a piece so that it threatens the opponent's king, the king is in check. The player must respond by moving their king out of check, blocking the check with another piece, or capturing the piece that is threatening the king. If there is no legal move to get out of check, the king is checkmated, and the game is over.
        Chess is a game that requires strategy, foresight, and patience. It is a game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages and skill levels, and its rich history and complexity have made it one of the most popular board games in the world. Chess has been used as a tool for education, with studies showing that playing chess can improve critical thinking skills, concentration, and memory. Chess is such an intriguing game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds.]

        [For those looking to improve their chess game, there is a wealth of resources available. One of the most important metrics in chess is the Elo rating system, which rates a player's skill level based on their performance in games against other rated players. When a player plays a game against another rated player, the outcome of the game is used to adjust their ratings. If the higher-rated player wins, their rating will stay the same or increase slightly, and the lower-rated player's rating will decrease. If the lower-rated player wins, their rating will increase significantly, and the higher-rated player's rating will decrease. The highest recorded Elo rating was achieved by Norwegian grandmaster Magnus Carlsen, who reached a rating of 2882 in 2014.
        There are many well-known chess influencers such as Gotham Chess, the Botez sisters, Eric Rosen, Hikaru Nakamura, and Agadmator, who offer tutorials and gameplay analysis to help players improve their skills as well as books like "My System" by Aron Nimzowitsch and "How to Reassess Your Chess" by Jeremy Silman, which have helped many players elevate their game. Even the best player in the world, Magnus Carlesen, ocassionally streams on twitch! It is of the utmost importance that you analyze your games after playing them. The ability to have a computer look at your game and calculate what you did wrong, what you did right, and relay all of that information right back to you is priceless when it comes to improving your game. Studying what the computer thinks of your playstyle, and adjusting when you see that you've messed up leads to learning patterns in the game of chess. Once you learn some of these patterns you will be able to play a lot more accurately and quickly.]

        [No discussion of chess would be complete without mentioning the greatest players of all time. While computers have long surpassed human players in terms of raw computational power, the achievements of players like Magnus Carlsen, Bobby Fischer, and Gary Kasparov remain awe-inspiring. The World Chess Championship is a prestigious title that is awarded to the winner of a tournament or match between the current world champion and a challenger. They usually play 12 games to decide the champion with a game win awarding 1 point to a player, a loss awarding 0 points to a player, and a draw awarding 0.5 points to each player. Both players will have 2 hours to play their first 40 moves, 1 hour to play their next 20 moves, and so on. This can result in very long games (the longest being the 1978 match between Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi. The game was played on July 18, 1978, and lasted for 124 moves over the course of 17 hours).
        The greatest players of all time have been much disputed, but the three people that are in every conversation are these 3 masters. Bobby Fischer's greatest achievement was winning the 1972 World Chess Championship and breaking the Soviet Union's stranglehold on the title; Gary Kasparov's greatest achievement was being the youngest undisputed World Chess Champion and holding the title for 15 years as well as having legendary matches against the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue; Magnus Carlsen's greatest achievement was becoming the highest-rated chess player in history and winning the World Chess Championship multiple times.]
