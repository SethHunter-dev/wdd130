        <h2>The Best Players in History</h2>
        <p>No discussion of chess would be complete without mentioning the greatest players of all time. While computers have long surpassed human players in terms of raw computational power, the achievements of players like Magnus Carlsen, Bobby Fischer, and Gary Kasparov remain awe-inspiring. The World Chess Championship is a prestigious title that is awarded to the winner of a tournament or match between the current world champion and a challenger. They usually play 12 games to decide the champion with a game win awarding 1 point to a player, a loss awarding 0 points to a player, and a draw awarding 0.5 points to each player. Both players will have 2 hours to play their first 40 moves, 1 hour to play their next 20 moves, and so on. This can result in very long games (the longest being the 1978 match between Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi. The game was played on July 18, 1978, and lasted for 124 moves over the course of 17 hours). The greatest players of all time have been much disputed, but the three people that are in every conversation are these 3 masters.</p>
