        <p>Chess is a game of skill, strategy, and mental agility. It's no wonder why it has been enjoyed for centuries, with its origins dating back to the Gupta Empire in India around the 6th century. I am sure you have seen a chessboard before, but here is how you can start playing right now (ranks are horizontal rows and files are vertical columns of squares on the chessboard).</p>

    <p>To start the game, each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The pieces are set up on the board in a specific way, with the pawns in front and the major pieces behind them. On each turn, a player may move one of their pieces according to its movement rules. The king can move one square in any direction, while the queen (worth 9 points) can move any number of squares in a straight line along a rank, file, or diagonal. The rooks (5 points) move any number of squares along a rank or file, the knights (3 points) move in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that, and the bishops (3 points) move any number of squares diagonally. The pawns (1 point) are the weakest pieces and can only move forward one square at a time, except for their first move when they can move two squares forward. Pawns capture diagonally and can promote to any piece if they reach the other side of the board. The point system does not actually give the player any points. It is simply a measurement of how powerful a piece is. If a player moves a piece so that it threatens the opponent's king, the king is in check. The player must respond by moving their king out of check, blocking the check with another piece, or capturing the piece that is threatening the king. If there is no legal move to get out of check, the king is checkmated, and the game is over.</p>
