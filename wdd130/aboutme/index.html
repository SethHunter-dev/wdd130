    <p>Hello! My name is Seth Hunter and I am an online student at BYUI currently living in Provo Utah. 
        I am a sophemore and my major is computer science. Right now I am focused on my BS, but am open to the idea of grad school in the future.
        The goal in getting this degree is to eventually be able to work for a tech company in either programming or cyber security.
    </p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include chess, rock climbing, piano, guitar, flipping, wrestling, movies, traveling, and much more. 
        I really like the outdoors, anything physical, and puzzles.
        For now I am working at a restraunt doing dishes, but hopefully will not be doing that forever.
    </p>
    <p>The biggest advantages of learning about careers in web design and the tech industry in general is that there are always going to be jobs centered around programming skills and they are fairly high paying jobs.
        I am taking this course because it is a course alligned with my major. It is also a good skill to have in general. People need good websites for their companies plus much more. I hope to gain an understanding of html, css, and more experience working with code/files.
    </p>
